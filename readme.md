### Write Scheme and Make Music by Lamu ###
Lamu (stands for LAmbda-MUsic Sequencer) is a music sequencer which enables 
users to write music as Scheme programs. In this system, musical notes and 
other informations are written as Scheme's association lists. The musical notes 
can be dynamically generated as Scheme's association lists on-the-fly.  Users 
can also interact with the dynamically generated music at runtime and affect 
the direction that the music is going.

Lamu is written in Java and Scheme which is powered by Kawa a Java based
Scheme implementation. You can send MIDI data via JACKAudio Connection Kit
a multiplatform audio connection system which is accessed via Java Native
Access.

Lamu runs on most major platforms which can run Java such as Windows, Mac-OSX
and various Linux distributions.

### About Me ###

I am a Japanese programmer born in 1973. I was born and raised in Tokyo.  
Therefore, I have never spoken English in daily life. Believe me. And Japanese 
people is one of the most English resistant people which is extremely stubborn.  
I know it and I have to admit it. But in the meantime I cannot help it.
I have tried so many times to educate this stubborn people and I finally gave 
up. They are too stubborn.  The grammar structure and pronunciation system in 
Japanese are very different from rest of the world and it is extremely 
difficult to make Japanese people understand the difference. It maybe because 
the geographical situation is so isolated from others that the history have 
been developed very differently.  I still haven't found the exact reason why 
Japanese is so different from others.

Therefore, you may find my documentation has some difficulty to be 
comprehended; I have to admit it and please excuse my English in advance. The 
following is a list of documentation which I have written so far about this 
program.

But there may be something that makes me different from other Japanese; I was 
living in _super-rural_ area in North-East Thailand for twelve years and I 
luckily did not die; there were many opportunities that I could die but I 
didn't. During the time I learned a dialect of Laotian language and eventually 
I could speak it very fluently. That experience opened me up to the other 
languages like English. And I studied Scheme in the same period.

Anyways, the following is the list.
