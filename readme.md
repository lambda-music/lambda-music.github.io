### Write Scheme and Make Music by Lamu ###
Lamu (stands for LAmbda-MUsic Sequencer) is a music sequencer which enables 
users to write music as Scheme programs. In this system, musical notes and 
other informations are written as Scheme's association lists. The musical notes 
can be dynamically generated as Scheme's association lists on-the-fly.  Users 
can also interact with the dynamically generated music at runtime and affect 
the direction that the music is going.

Lamu is written in Java and Scheme. It equipped with Kawa a Java based Scheme 
implementation. You can send MIDI data via JACKAudio Connection Kit a 
multiplatform audio connection system which is accessed via Java Native Access.

Lamu runs on most major platforms which can run Java such as Windows, Mac-OSX
and various Linux distributions.

### About Me ###
I am a Japanese programmer born in 1973. I was born and raised in Tokyo.  
Therefore, I have never spoken English in daily life. And Japanese people is 
one of the most English resistant people. And I am no exception. The grammar 
structure and pronunciation system in Japanese are very different from the rest 
of the world. For Japanese people, it is extremely difficult to understand the 
difference between themselves and others.  Japan is geographical isolated from 
others; therefore, the history have been developed very differently.  I still 
haven't found the exact reason why Japanese is so different from others.

Therefore, you may find my documentation has some difficulty to be 
comprehended; I have to admit it and please excuse my English in advance. The 
following is a list of documentation which I have written so far about this 
program.

There may be something that makes me different from other Japanese; I was 
living in a rural area in North-East Thailand for twelve years. During the 
time, I had encountered many opportunities that could lead me to death, but I 
luckily survived.  In the time, I learned a dialect of Laotian language and 
eventually I could acquire the ability to speak it very fluently. That 
experience opened me up to the other languages like English. And additionally I 
studied Scheme in the same period.

I learned Laotian music at that time and I found it had some similarities with 
jazz. I am a jazz guitarist. I have been experimenting to search the way to mix 
jazz, Laotian music and other music for decades. And I hope someday I can 
develop a whole new type of music.

Less have I visited to English spoken countries; I have visited to Boston, 
Massachusetts back in 1996 for only three month and 2002 for only a month. My 
English ability is quite limited. Please, excuse my English and thank you for 
your corporation to be patient to the immatureness.
